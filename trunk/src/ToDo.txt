use static methods on static classes--abuse generics to specify options??


Partially-complete:

-BLAS coverage

-LAPACK coverage

-VML coverage

-Offset-enabled versions of the above

-Unit tests for the above



Unstarted:

-Random number generators

-FFTs



Other things we haven't done in a long time:

-Profiling & benchmarking
-Maintaining XML docs & code comments
