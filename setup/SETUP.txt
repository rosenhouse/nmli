Required environment variables:
NMLI_PATH=C:\path\to\nmli
NMLI_IMPL=MKL or ACML

When Nmli.dll is loaded, it chooses a implementation based on NMLI_IMPL
and looks for the native binaries in a subdirectory of NMLI_PATH



The scripts in this folder setup the directory hierarchy at Nmli\bin

You will likely need to set a couple path variables defined at
the top of the scripts, but they are otherwise reasonably automated.


When they complete successfully on Windows XP x64, the full directory layout should be

Nmli
+---bin
¦   +---x64
¦   ¦   +---ACML
¦   ¦   +---MKL
¦   +---x86
¦       +---ACML
¦       +---MKL
+---custom-dll-builder
+---src
    +---Nmli ...
    +---NmliTests ...
    +---Standalone Tester


With the contents of Nmli\bin being

Nmli\bin\Nmli.dll
Nmli\bin\x64
Nmli\bin\x86
Nmli\bin\x64\ACML
Nmli\bin\x64\MKL
Nmli\bin\x64\ACML\libacml_dll.dll
Nmli\bin\x64\ACML\libacml_mv_dll.dll
Nmli\bin\x64\ACML\libguide40.dll
Nmli\bin\x64\ACML\libifcoremd.dll
Nmli\bin\x64\ACML\libmmd.dll
Nmli\bin\x64\MKL\libguide40.dll
Nmli\bin\x64\MKL\mkl.dll
Nmli\bin\x86\ACML
Nmli\bin\x86\MKL
Nmli\bin\x86\ACML\libacml_dll.dll
Nmli\bin\x86\ACML\libifcoremd.dll
Nmli\bin\x86\ACML\libmmd.dll
Nmli\bin\x86\MKL\libguide40.dll
Nmli\bin\x86\MKL\mkl.dll


Obviously if you run only the 32-bit setup you won't get the x64 folder.
